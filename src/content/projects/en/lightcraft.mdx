I’m just a girl who feels everything deeply, the colors in the sky, the small moments, the quiet between words. I create things from the heart, whether it’s art, writing, or just dreamy ideas that keep me up at night. I see beauty in the little things, and I try to turn that beauty into something meaningful.

And then… there’s her. Ashav. The one who makes everything brighter.

I didn’t know love could feel like this, soft, consuming, and safe all at once. She’s the kind of person who walks into a room and suddenly everything feels lighter. Her voice? It’s like poetry wrapped in comfort. People love being around her because she makes them feel seen. I love being around her because she makes me feel like I’m exactly where I’m meant to be.

I’m still me, the girl with wild thoughts and soft hands, messy sketches and slow jazzy songs but now I’m filled with something even more powerful, love. A love that builds me, calms me, and teaches me to grow.

Being in love with Ashav doesn’t take away from who I am. It just adds a whole new light to the art I create and the life I live.
