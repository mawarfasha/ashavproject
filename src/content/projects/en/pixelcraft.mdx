Uran is literally the definition of chaotic little brother energy. Like… he’s so unserious 90% of the time but somehow ends up being the funniest person in the room without even trying. He’s always making the stupid meme sound and doing weird dances in front of ashav like it's his own personal world. Goofy guy so funny.

His Roblox game is wild. If you see someone named annoyinglilboi, RUN AWAY HAHA yeah that’s him , full confidence. 

But honestly, life’s way more fun with Uran around. He’s goofy, loud, sometimes annoying, but in the most lovable way possible. Never a dull moment when he’s in the house.
